-- In the person.sql file, write out the code for the following problems:

-- 1. Create a table called person that records a personâ€™s id, name, age, height (in cm) , city, favorite_color. id should be an auto-incrementing id/primary key (use type: SERIAL)

CREATE TABLE persons (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
  age INTEGER,
  height_cm FlOAT,
  city VARCHAR(20),
  favorite_color VARCHAR(20)
  );

-- 2. Add 5 different people into the person database. Remember to not include the person_id because it should auto-increment.
INSERT INTO persons (name)
Values ('Chris'),
('Bobby'),
('Julie'),
('Mark'),
('Jim');

INSERT INTO persons (name, age, height_cm, city, favorite_color)
VALUES ('Misty', '3', '30', 'Miami, FL', 'cat food brown'),

('Mark', '3', '175', 'Chapin, SC', 'Navy'),
('Jim','3', '175', 'Cairns, QLD', 'Ocean Blue');

-- 3. Select all the people in the person table by height from tallest to shortest.

-- 4. Select all the people in the person table by height from shortest to tallest.
SELECT * FROM persons 
ORDER BY height_cm ASC;

-- 5. Select all the people in the person table by age from oldest to youngest.

SELECT * FROM persons WHERE age = 18;

-- 8. Select all the people in the person table that are less than 20 and older than 30.
SELECT * FROM persons WHERE age BETWEEN 20 AND 30;

-- 12. Select all the people in the person table where their favorite color is orange or green.
SELECT * FROM persons WHERE favorite_color = 'orange' OR favorite_color = 'green';
